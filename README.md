# logfrett-portfolio-site

This is my personal portfolio website, built as part of the BAIS:3300 Digital Product Management course at the University of Iowa. It showcases who I am, what I do, and where I’m headed — including a preview of my future role at RSM as a staff accountant in tax. Designed with HTML5 UP’s Dimension template and customized with personal content, social links, Google Analytics, and legal compliance pages, this site highlights my skills in web design, version control, and project management.
